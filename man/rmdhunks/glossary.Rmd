The presser package uses vocabulary that is standard for web apps, especially those developed with Express.js, but not necessarily well known to all R package developers.

**Apps** Central to this package are _apps_ that are fake web services, fake web APIs.
When you define them they are not started, you start them either by using the `$listen()` method,
 or by launching them in a new process. See `?presser::new_app`.
Until you start it an app is no more than its specifications, and can be shared/saved to disk.
 
**Routes** As explained in [Express.js docs](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html), 
"Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.".
Each route therefore is defined by a combination of HTTP methods 
(`get()`, `post()`, etc. or `all()` for any HTTP method) and
a path definition (a string, parameterized string or regular expression).
  
**Middleware** As explained in [Express.js docs](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html), 
"Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), 
the response object (res), and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle."
They are in the middle between request and response.
So middleware functions are what you use to parse the request (query, body), to produce a response
 and to change data in the app's local environment.
There are built-in middleware functions in the package, and you can add your own.
 
**Handler stack** This is a fancy word to mention both routes and middleware functions.
Together they define _what_ your web service does (middleware) _for what request_ (routes).
