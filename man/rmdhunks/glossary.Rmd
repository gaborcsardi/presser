The presser package uses vocabulary that is standard for web apps, especially those developed with Express.js, but not necessarily well known to all R package developers.

**Apps** Central to this package are _apps_ that are fake web services, fake web APIs.
When you define them they are not started, you start them either by using the `$listen()` method,
 or by launching them in a new process. See `?presser::new_app`.
Until you start it an app is no more than its specifications, and can be shared/saved to disk.
 
**Routes** As explained in [Express.js docs](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html), 
"Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.".
Each route therefore is defined by a combination of HTTP methods 
(`get()`, `post()`, etc. or `all()` for any HTTP method) and
a path definition (a string, parameterized string or regular expression), and by some code using handler functions.
If you don't define any route, your app will return 404 for all requests.

**Handler functions**
Handler functions are what you use to parse the request (query, body), to produce a response
 and, optionally, to change data in the app's local environment (so that further requests 
 will have access to it).
  
**Middleware** As explained in [Express.js docs](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html), 
"Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), 
the response object (res), and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle."
They are in the middle between request and response.
You have to view them as utility functions for the whole app. 
In vocabulary close to usethis' functions, when you write `app$use(mw_raw())` the whole app will have
 access to the middleware `mw_raw()`.
There are built-in middleware functions in the package (their name starts with `mw_`), 
and you can add your own.
 
**Handler stack** This is a fancy word to mention both routes and middleware functions.
Together they define _what_ your web service does _for what request_ (routes, handler functions), 
with _what tools_ (middleware functions).
